"""What every tier of this suite shares: where the repository is, and how a test is skipped.

The suite is read by tier — ``unit/``, ``integration/``, ``system/`` — and each tier states
in its own ``conftest.py`` what it forbids. This file holds only what all three need.

**A skip names the command that would run the test.** A skip whose reason is a condition —
``"needs the database"``, ``"no model on disk"`` — teaches a reader that the test is
unrunnable. A skip that says ``run: docker compose up -d postgres`` teaches them how to run
it. Use :func:`skip_unless` and the message writes itself.
